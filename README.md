## How to work our websit ?

 Whether you're a businessperson searching for new initiatives to invest 
in or a family hoping to construct a secure and stable foundation, 
everyone wants to acquire a suitable piece of land on which to develop 
their ambitions. There are other occasions when landowners must sell 
their property for a variety of reasons. However, today's people are 
extremely busy. They don't have time to look for suitable land, and 
selling land is tough. The Online land sale system enables the seller to 
sell land, customers to browse, buy the property, and if a customer 
wants to apply for a loan, there is a credit officer to approve the loan 
facility, and a land manager to approve and reject requests for selling 
lands and also an admin to maintain the accounts. There are two types 
of users that users can use in online system. They are guest and 
registered user. To be a registered user, the user has to register to the 
system using our website and give the correct details of the user. All 
the information is stored in a database. When a person becomes a 
registered user of our system, he can get the email that includes all of 
his/ her user ID, password and other relevant information from admin. 
After those users can access the system. When a person wants to sell a 
land, he can request to the land manager. And the land manager accepts 
the request and upload advertisements about accepted lands into our 
website. If a customer wants to apply for a loan, he must fill a form and 
get approval by the credit officer. Firstly, the user must enter a 
username and password. In this time system checks the validity of the 
user logging details. Then the seller and customer can contact each 
otherâ€™s. And he/she can send feedback to the system. The system admin 
updates the system and will check the details of all users and all the 
accounts of the users.
